Just about every technical person in the company will get this email.  Don't abuse it.  We have emailer-id and will come to your house if we have to.</div><div><br /></div><div>Announcements: <i>Email groups</i>.  We're all members of some group or another.  And all groups need to have announcements made from time to time.  Email groups are great for announcements.  They're also best left to the group moderator, typically the supervisor or manager.</div><div><br /></div>Day-to-day Communications, akin to meetings: <i>Email appropriate recipients only and do so with care</i>.<div><ul><li><i>Always be mindful of your recipient list</i>.  Don't add everyone you know plus two more just for good measure.  Email only the people you wish to discuss the topic with as you would in a meeting.  Don't force people into conversations; typically this means that you should <b>not</b> email groups.  Instead of group lists, utilize Discussion Forums, such as Google+.</li><li><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt"><i>Always use reply-all</i>.  Email messages with multiple recipients are like meetings... you don't generally whisper your responses to your neighbor; always use reply-all, but always be mindful of your recipient list.  Sometimes you need to have a private conversation with another individual after the meeting.  </span>So take this heading with a grain of salt: <i>almost</i> always use reply-all.</li><li><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt"><i>Limit the frequency of the use of this particular medium</i>.  Each new email topic is like gathering all of the recipients into the company conference room.  Do you really need to gather the whole team into the room disruptively to ask one member for a client's <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FTPS_report&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEzdBkBWgjFRGO0dXw4RCJa7yV7nwsg">TPS</a> report?  More on that next...:</span></li><li><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt"><i>Multiple recipients are not a drop-in replacement for individual but identical messages</i>.  Sometimes you need to ask the same thing 10 times as opposed to asking only once in front of 10 people.  This is an opportunity to utilize the BCC field, this way people don't have to feel obligated (nor can they should they unfortunately feel that way) to answer aloud in the crowd.</span></li><li><i>Don't be overly verbose</i>.  Quote only that which you are referring to, not the 12th signature from 8 messages ago.  Seriously, the recipients have your cell phone number by now.  Your message body should contain just enough context to help your audience understand your perspective.  Gmail Lab's Quote Tool is very helpful here.  Select the text you're responding to and then click reply.</li><li><i>Be mindful of your signature; your digital business card</i>.  You wouldn't hand out your business card to every person you've ever met every time you meet them; don't automatically apply your signature to every email you send.  Instead, apply it exceptionally intentionally.  Apply it when you meet someone new, perhaps even the first few times.  Include it also for particularly critical messages that have depth.  Signatures serve as your business card as well as your seal of approval.  Just because software lets you apply it automatically to every "How's the weather?" message doesn't mean you should.  Software doesn't know any better.  Gmail Lab's Canned Responses allow you to quickly and easily apply your signature (or any other canned message).</li><li><i>Be mindful of your mobile signature</i>.  It's commonplace for mobiles to have a very simple signature and to even blatantly advertise that this communication came from a mobile.  The original history is one of advertisement (Sent from my iPhone or Sent from my Droid) but has since evolved into a disclaimer letting the recipient know that any typos are the result of using a mobile.  Using a mobile is no excuse for typos or poorly written communications.  A "Sent from mobile" signature implies less time and thought went into the message.</li><li><i>Maintain integrity and insist that others do the same</i>.  When you agree to an action items, follow through; when someone else agrees to one, politely prod them until they do.  Software tools like <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.activeinboxhq.com&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEzfacguMs_aalhsFrif971kZLCyJ9Q">ActiveInbox</a> can help with this, but they can't do it without your guidance.</li><li><i>Be polite, be courteous, keep banter to a minimum</i>.  Every email you send in your professional life is akin to having the same communication in the company conference room.  Behave at least as well in email as you would in the conference room.  Perhaps polish both.</li><li><i>Adjust the thread's subject when the thread's subject changes.</i>  If you're going to change the recipients, you're probably changing the topic of conversation as well.  So instead of whispering other things to a subset of people, go to a different room and speak more freely, clearly, and with less stress.</li><li><i>Help keep recipients lists free of clones, set your email settings to reply as the address sent to.</i>  Set your default Reply-To to be First.Last@keystone-it.com and, more importantly, set your <u>replying to a message setting</u> to be <u>reply from the same address the message was sent to</u>.<br /></li></ul><div>Day-to-day Communications, akin to cubicle chit-chat: <i>Gather participates in a predetermined area</i>.</div><div><ul><li><i>Chat rapidly, chat freely</i>.  Use something that you and all your participates can agree on.  Is that IRC?  Google Hangouts?  Bulletin Boards of the pre-dot-com era?  Or perhaps its some cozy physical space with beanbag chairs and pinball machines.  Whatever floats your majority boats...</li></ul></div><div>Discussion Forums: <i>Google Plus</i>.  You have things to say.  Don't pester everyone in the room, just find a quiet spot somewhere nearby where people can come and go as they please.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Communicate with the right people: Co-workers, clients, teammates.  Oh yeah, <i>don't forget vendors, manufactures' technical support centers, and other subject matter experts</i>.</div><div><ul><li><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt"><i>Ask for help</i>.  In addition to the obvious channels, outside SMEs have much more concern for your well being with the problem that you're facing than you realize.  There are a lot of people in the world ready to help, and the toll-free phone number should make that plenty clear.  In any case, stop scratching your head and ask for help, and you won't even have to swallow your pride to do so!</span></li></ul></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
